NOTES

WHAT ARE THESE DOING? 
** res.send ()

- WE ARE SENDING SOMETHNG FROM THE API TO THE CLIENT SIDE
___

** res.sendFile()

- WE USUALY HAVE A PUBLIC FOLDER THAT HAS A FILE SUCH AS INDEX.HTML. USE THE RELATIVE
PATH TO GET TO THE FILE WE WANT TO SEND. 

EX: res.sendFile("./public/index.html") 

this is an absolute path, which is not very good. 

-- what we can do, is const path = require('path')
res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, "./public/index.html"))


- THE RESPONSE IS SENDING THE FILE THAT WE HAVE FROM THE SERVER SIDE TO THE
CLIENT'S SIDE.

** res.json()

-- always a good thing to send it as an object. 
    res.json({test: "OK!"})
